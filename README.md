# LinkTIC E-commerce Platform

## Introduction
Welcome to the LinkTIC e-commerce platform documentation. This document covers the architectural choices, technologies, and methodologies applied in the development of both the backend and frontend of our e-commerce solution. This project aims to demonstrate not only technical proficiency but also a commitment to best practices in software engineering.

## Backend

### Overview
The backend of LinkTIC is designed to be robust, scalable, and efficient. It supports all the data processing and business logic required to run an e-commerce platform efficiently.

### Technologies Used
- **NodeJS and ExpressJS:** Chosen for their scalability and the vast ecosystem. We use ExpressJS to create RESTful APIs that are both efficient and easy to maintain.
- **Express Validator:** This library is integral to our validation strategy, ensuring that all data received from the frontend meets our strict criteria, thus safeguarding data integrity and application security.
- **Cloudinary:** Utilized for its superior capabilities in managing media assets. It helps in automatically optimizing image and video content for various devices, enhancing loading times and user experience.
- **TypeORM:** Chosen for its advanced ORM capabilities, ease of use with TypeScript, and its ability to streamline complex data interactions with PostgreSQL.

### Configuration and Environment Variables
#### Backend
Detailed documentation of all necessary backend environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for the PostgreSQL database.
- `PORT`: The port on which the server runs.
- `STAGE`: Indicates the stage of deployment (dev, prod).
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`: Credentials for Cloudinary services.

#### Frontend
Essential environment variables for the frontend:
- `PUBLIC_APP_URL_PORT`: The port on which the frontend application runs, set to 3001.
- `PUBLIC_APP_URL_BASE`: The base URL for the frontend application, set to localhost.
- `PUBLIC_APP_URL_PROTOCOL`: The protocol used for the frontend application, typically set to http://.

### Design Patterns and Best Practices
- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. Applied primarily to manage database connections.
- **Error Handling:** Rigorous error handling mechanisms are in place to manage and log errors effectively, which helps in maintaining high reliability and uptime.

### Commands and Scripts
- **Database Seeding:** `npm run seed`: This command uses TypeORM seeding to populate the database with initial data, crucial for development and testing.

## Frontend

### Overview
The frontend of LinkTIC is built to provide an intuitive, responsive, and accessible user experience. It utilizes modern web development tools and practices to achieve a high standard of user interaction.

### Technologies and Tools
- **SvelteKit:** Chosen for its innovative approach to building efficient and highly interactive user interfaces with a minimal footprint.
- **TailwindCSS:** Utilized for its utility-first approach to CSS that allows us to rapidly style applications without sacrificing performance.

### Key Features and Interactions
- **State Management:** Leveraging SvelteKit's built-in store system to manage application state across multiple components, which simplifies state management and enhances reactivity.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures that the application is accessible and functional on a wide range of devices, from smartphones to desktop computers.

## Problem Statement and Proposed Solution
LinkTIC aims to address the need for a high-performing, scalable, and secure e-commerce platform that can handle a diverse range of products and transactions.

### Proposed Solution
We have developed a comprehensive architecture that supports high transaction volumes and integrates seamlessly with various payment and shipment services. This architecture not only meets current e-commerce demands but is also designed to be adaptable to future technologies and market requirements.

## Conclusion
The LinkTIC platform is a testament to the use of cutting-edge technologies and methodologies in creating a market-leading e-commerce solution. We continue to refine our platform based on user feedback and new technological advancements, ensuring it remains at the forefront of e-commerce solutions.
